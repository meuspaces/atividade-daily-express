                        Millenials aged 34 to 36 in 2017 were 11 percent less healthy than Gen Xers

                        When compared to the national population, millenials are more affected by behavioral
                        health conditions <br> than physical, with the highest increases shown in rates of
                        major depression and hyperactivity.

                Although millenials may seem to have a greater investment in health and welness than<br>
                generations before them, findings from the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association (BCBSA)<br>
                suggest millenials will be substantially less healthy as they age.
            </p>
            <br>

            <p>
                The report defines the following as the the top 10 conditions affecting millenials, 
                ranking by <br> adverse health impact:

        <div>
            <p>
                "While the top 10 conditions affecting millenials are not necessarily surprising,
                what is <br> shocking in the prevalence rates  for each of these conditions in 
                millenials when <br> compared to rates  for previous generations, "Dr.Vincent Nelson
                , vice president of medical <br> affairs for the BCBSA, told Heathline.

            </p>
            <br>

            <p>
                Millenials aged 34 to 36 in 2017 were 11 percent less  heathly than Gen Xers aged 34
                to <br> 36 in 2014, and had a double digit increase in diagnoses for eight of Top
                10 health <br> conditions.

            </p>
            <br>

            <p>
                Still, 83 percent of the 55 millions millenials surveyed in 2017 considered themselves<br>
                in good or excellent health, despite the BCBSA analysis revealing otherwise.

            <br>

            <p>
                "Because significant health challenges are rising among millenials earlier than in <br>
                previous generations, we mus address these issues now, "said Nelson.

            <h2> Mental health conditions hit millenials hardest </h2>
        

        <div>
            <p>
                When compared to the national population, millenials are more affected  by hehavorial <br>
                health conditions than physical, with the highest increases shown in rates of major <br>
                depression and hyperactivity.
            </p><br>

            <p>
                "While we may be seeing moderate diagnosis impact across all generations for previously <br>
                stigmatized behavioral health conditions, millenials are seeing higher growth in <br>
                prevalence than either Gen X or baby boomers, "said Nelson.
            </p><br>

            <p>
                Major depression, substance abuse disorder, and alcohol use disorder were the top three <br>
                contitions for millenials.
            </p><br>

            <p>
                Deborah Serani, PsyD, professor at Adelphi University and award-winning author of<br>
                "Living with Depression," says the prevalence of these conditions among millenials<br>
                doesn't surprise her.
            </p><br>

            <p>
                She believes the following circumstances in which millenials grew up are contributing<br>
                factors:

                <li>
                    <h3> Technological advances</h3>
                    <p> Because of technology, millenials were the first generation to grow up
                        without learning <br> how to maintain eye contact, become adept at reading
                        facial expressions, or deepen<br> awareness of the textures of emotions within
                        themselves or others.
                    </p>

                    <p> "This lack of emotionals awareness, clinically called alexithymia, makes is hard
                        for <br> millenials to understand their thoughts and feeling,"Serani told Heathline.

                <li>
                    <h3> Media Overload </h3>
                    <p> Serani says the media explosion of the internet created a 24-hour new cycle,
                        which <br> allowed kids to access fearful news.
                    </p>

                    <p> "Stories of terrorism, natural disaster, or catastrophes that were nonexistent
                        generations <br> ago, are new avalaible around the clock.

        <h2> How healthcare can change to help more millenials </h2>
        

        <div>
            <p>
                To gain a better understanding of the decline in millenials's health accross
                all illnesses, <br> Nelson says BCBSA hels sessions with companies accross the 
                country.
            </p>

            <p>
                He says the following were takeaways about how to better address current millenial<br>
                lifestyles:
            </p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <ul> 
                <li> 
                    <p> Millenials want to be met where they are with access to their own health
                        records and convenient care, <br> including telemedecine-they don't want
                        another app to download.
                    </p>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <p>
                        Because millenials are disproportionately affected by behavorial health
                        conditions, the prefer a holistic <br> approach to their health that 
                        integrates both mind and body.
                    </p>

                </li>

                <li>
                    <p>
                        Millenials have had a double digit increase in diagnoses for eight of the Top
                        10 ealthconditions.
                    </p>
                </li>

                <li> 
                    <p>
                        Millenials would rather work in environments able to address behavioral health
                        and its underliying <br> issues without stigma.
                    </p>
                </li>
               <br>

        </div>

        <div>
            <p>
                When it comes to depression, Nelson says while 89 percent of American adults
                consider <br> depression a very serious condition, the majority believe not
                enough <br> resources are being allocated to depression.
            </p>

            <p>
               "One particularity troubling trend we've identified is that 1 and 5 millenials
               diagnosed with <br> major depression are not seeking any form of treatment,
               "said Nelson. "BCBSA's study of <br> major depression found the condition
                can rob people of 9  or more years of heathly life, so <br> it's imperative
                to allocate research and resources to new treatments as more millenials <br>
                are diagnosed with this and other behavorial helath conditions."
